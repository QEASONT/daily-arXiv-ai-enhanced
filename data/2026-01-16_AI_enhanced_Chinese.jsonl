STMs simplify atomicity. Recent STMs can achieve good performance for some workloads but they have some limitations. In particular, STMs typically cannot support long-running reads which access a large number of addresses that are frequently updated. Multiversioning is a common approach used to support this type of workload. However, multiversioning is often expensive and can reduce the performance of transactions where versioning is not necessary. In this work we present Multiverse, a new STM that combines the best of both unversioned TM and multiversioning. Multiverse features versioned and unversioned transactions which can execute concurrently. A main goal of Multiverse is to ensure that unversioned transactions achieve performance comparable to the state of the art unversioned STM while still supporting fast versioned transactions needed to enable long running reads. We implement Multiverse and compare it against several STMs. Our experiments demonstrate that Multiverse achieves comparable or better performance for common case workloads where there are no long running reads. For workloads with long running reads and frequent updates Multiverse significantly outperforms existing STMS. In several cases for these workloads the throughput of Multiverse is several orders of magnitude faster than other STMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Multiverse\u901a\u8fc7\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u53d1\u7684\u7248\u672c\u5316\u548c\u975e\u7248\u672c\u5316\u4e8b\u52a1\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u517c\u5bb9\u4e0d\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u8bfb\u53d6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u80dc\u51fa\u73b0\u6709STM\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u4e5f\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709STM\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u957f\u8bfb\u53d6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u591a\u7248\u672c\u5316\u867d\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u8bfb\u53d6\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u5f15\u5165\u9ad8\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u666e\u901a\u4e8b\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4e9f\u9700\u517c\u987e\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u70b9\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMultiverse\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u65e0\u7248\u672cSTM\u548c\u591a\u7248\u672cSTM\u4f18\u70b9\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e8b\u52a1\u5b58\u50a8\uff08STM\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7248\u672c\u5316\u4e0e\u975e\u7248\u672c\u5316\u4e8b\u52a1\u5e76\u53d1\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "Multiverse\u5728\u65e0\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u8bfb\u53d6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65e0\u7248\u672cSTM\u5ab2\u7f8e\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u8bfb\u53d6\u53ca\u9891\u7e41\u66f4\u65b0\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709STM\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "Multiverse\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfSTM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u957f\u8bfb\u53d6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u77ed\u677f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5e38\u89c4\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u65e0\u7248\u672cSTM\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3aSTM\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Many resources are created using vocabularies that are FAIR-compliant and well-annotated, yet the collective ecosystem of these resources often fails to interoperate effectively in practice. This continued challenge is mainly due to variation in identifier schemas and data models used in these resources. We have created two tools to bridge the chasm between interoperability in principle and interoperation in practice. Babel solves the problem of multiple identifier schemes by producing a curated set of identifier mappings to create cliques of equivalent identifiers that are exposed through high-performance APIs. ORION solves the problems of multiple data models by ingesting knowledge bases and transforming them into a common, community-managed data model.

Most FD discovery algorithms find all valid dependencies, but this causes two problems. First, the computational cost is prohibitive: computational complexity grows quadratically with the number of tuples and exponentially with the number of attributes, making discovery slow on large-scale and high-dimensional data. Second, the result set can be huge, making it hard to identify useful dependencies. We propose SDP (Selective-Discovery-and-Prune), which discovers the top-$k$ FDs ranked by redundancy count. Redundancy count measures how much duplicated information an FD explains and connects directly to storage overhead and update anomalies. SDP uses an upper bound on redundancy to prune the search space. It is proved that this upper bound is monotone: adding attributes refines partitions and thus decreases the bound. Once the bound falls below the top-$k$ threshold, the entire branch can be skipped. We improve SDP with three optimizations: ordering attributes by partition cardinality, using pairwise statistics in a Partition Cardinality Matrix to tighten bounds, and a global scheduler to explore promising branches first. Experiments on over 40 datasets show that SDP is much faster and uses less memory than exhaustive methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "SDP\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5197\u4f59\u4e0a\u754c\u526a\u679d\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u6392\u5e8f\u3001\u5bf9\u754c\u6536\u7d27\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\u7b49\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86FD\u53d1\u73b0\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u572840+\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfFD\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u7ed3\u679c\u96c6\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u3002\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6709\u6548\u9074\u9009\u6709\u4ef7\u503cFD\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3aFD\u6392\u5e8f\u51c6\u5219\u3002 2. \u5f15\u5165\u5355\u8c03\u5197\u4f59\u4e0a\u754c\u526a\u679d\u65e0\u6548\u5206\u652f\u3002 3. \u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u6392\u5e8f\u3001Partition Cardinality Matrix\u6536\u7d27\u754c\u9650\u3002 4. \u5168\u5c40\u8c03\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u904d\u5386\u6f5c\u529b\u5206\u652f\u3002 5. \u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SDP\uff08Selective-Discovery-and-Prune\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u53d1\u73b0\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u6570\u6392\u540d\u524dk\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\uff08FDs\uff09\uff0c\u6781\u5927\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "SDP\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u6709\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684FD\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u7701\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u5927\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Following this idea, we present the design of TransactionMerger, a middleware to collect and merge transactions across different clients. We further present a static analysis tool to identify the merging opportunity without violating isolation as well as our experience of re-writing transactions in TPC-C and Spree, a popular real-world application. Our evaluation shows that such transaction merging can improve TPC-C throughput by up to 2.65X and Spree throughput by 3.52X.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u5e76\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u4e8b\u52a1\u8bed\u53e5\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86TransactionMerger\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef6\u548c\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e8b\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728TPC-C\u4e0eSpree\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe2.65\u500d\u548c3.52\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e8b\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u9762\u4e34\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u5c42\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u4e14\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u4e8b\u52a1\u8bed\u53e5\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6316\u6398\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bed\u53e5\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u6f5c\u529b\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u541e\u5410\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5206\u6790\u5408\u5e76\u76f8\u4f3c\u4e8b\u52a1\u8bed\u53e5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6d88\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u8bfb\u53d6\u548c\u5408\u5e76\u7ade\u6001\u8bed\u53e5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u5408\u5e76\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86TransactionMerger\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef6\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u76f8\u4f3c\u8bed\u53e5\u6216\u4e8b\u52a1\u5408\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5e94\u7528\u7aef\u4e8b\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u5e76\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8bed\u53e5\u3001\u6d88\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u8bfb\u53d6\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5408\u5e76\u4e8b\u52a1\u95f4\u7ade\u6001\u8bed\u53e5\u5e76\u9884\u5148\u8ba1\u7b97\u5176\u805a\u5408\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8b\u52a1\u91cd\u5199\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86TransactionMerger\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef6\uff0c\u53ef\u8de8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6536\u96c6\u5e76\u5408\u5e76\u4e8b\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u5408\u5e76\u673a\u4f1a\u4e14\u4e0d\u7834\u574f\u9694\u79bb\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5728TPC-C\u4e0eSpree\uff08\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff09\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e8b\u52a1\u91cd\u5199\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e8b\u52a1\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e94\u7528\u4fa7\u4e8b\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u9694\u79bb\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u624b\u6bb5\u3002"}}

This paper develops a general framework for thinking about the existential risk of AI systems. We analyze a two premise argument that AI systems pose a threat to humanity. Premise one: AI systems will become extremely powerful. Premise two: if AI systems become extremely powerful, they will destroy humanity. We use these two premises to construct a taxonomy of survival stories, in which humanity survives into the far future. In each survival story, one of the two premises fails. Either scientific barriers prevent AI systems from becoming extremely powerful; or humanity bans research into AI systems, thereby preventing them from becoming extremely powerful; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because their goals prevent them from doing so; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because we can reliably detect and disable systems that have the goal of doing so. We argue that different survival stories face different challenges. We also argue that different survival stories motivate different responses to the threats from AI. Finally, we use our taxonomy to produce rough estimates of P(doom), the probability that humanity will be destroyed by AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9AI\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u98ce\u9669\u5f52\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e24\u6761\u524d\u63d0\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u751f\u5b58\u6545\u4e8b\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u524d\u63d0\u5931\u6548\u573a\u666f\u63a2\u8ba8\u4eba\u7c7b\u5e78\u5b58\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u751f\u5b58\u6982\u7387\u4f30\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u56de\u5e94\u5173\u4e8eAI\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u4e89\u8bba\uff0c\u5398\u6e05AI\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u751f\u5b58\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5e2e\u52a9\u66f4\u597d\u7406\u89e3\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u5bf9\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaAI\u751f\u5b58\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e24\u6761\u524d\u63d0\u8bba\u8bc1AI\u7684\u751f\u5b58\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u5b58\u6545\u4e8b\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u60c5\u5883\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AI\u751f\u5b58\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u51e0\u7c7b\u751f\u5b58\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u6bcf\u7c7b\u6545\u4e8b\u4e2d\u81f3\u5c11\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u524d\u63d0\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5e78\u5b58\uff1b\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5404\u7c7b\u751f\u5b58\u6545\u4e8b\u6240\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u6311\u6218\u548c\u6fc0\u52b1\u7684\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u6846\u67b6\u7ed9\u51fa\u4eba\u7c7b\u88abAI\u6bc1\u706d\u6982\u7387\u7684\u7c97\u7565\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u53ef\u5f52\u7eb3\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u524d\u63d0\uff0c\u82e5\u81f3\u5c11\u4e00\u4e2a\u524d\u63d0\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u5219\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u5e78\u5b58\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u5b58\u6545\u4e8b\u8981\u6c42\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6280\u672f\u3001\u653f\u7b56\u6216\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5e94\u5bf9\u3002\u672c\u6587\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5e94\u5bf9AI\u98ce\u9669\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

We investigate whether multi-agent systems function as strategic reasoners capable of payoff optimization or as identity-driven actors that prioritize role alignment over explicit incentives. Using Nash equilibrium achievement as a diagnostic for strategic reasoning, we conduct systematic experiments across four LLM architectures (Qwen-7B, Qwen-32B, Llama-8B, Mistral-7B) in complex environmental decision-making games involving four agents. We show that role identity bias fundamentally alters strategic reasoning even when payoff-optimal equilibria exist and complete payoff information is available. Removing personas and providing explicit payoffs enables Qwen models to achieve high Nash equilibrium rates, indicating that both conditions are necessary for strategic reasoning. In contrast, personas systematically bias equilibrium selection toward socially preferred outcomes: with personas present, all of the achieved equilibria correspond to Green Transition, while models entirely fail to reach equilibrium when Tragedy of the Commons is payoff-optimal. The effect of explicit payoffs depends entirely on persona presence, revealing strong interactions between representational design choices. We also observe clear model-dependent patterns. Qwen architectures are highly sensitive to both personas and payoff visibility, whereas Llama and Mistral exhibit rigid reasoning behavior across conditions. These findings demonstrate that representational choices are substantive governance decisions that determine whether multi-agent systems act as strategic reasoners or identity-driven actors, with important implications for real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u6536\u76ca\u4fe1\u606f\u5c55\u793a\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u6b64\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u76f4\u63a5\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u6cbb\u7406\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u52a8\u56e0\uff08\u662f\u6218\u7565\u6536\u76ca\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8fd8\u662f\u89d2\u8272\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08\u5982persona\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3001\u6536\u76ca\u4fe1\u606f\u5c55\u793a\uff09\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5398\u6e05\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6218\u7565\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7a76\u7adf\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u6218\u7565\u7406\u6027\u8fd8\u662f\u8eab\u4efd\u9a71\u52a8\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7a76\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u51b3\u7b56\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u56db\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08Qwen-7B\u3001Qwen-32B\u3001Llama-8B\u3001Mistral-7B\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89d2\u8272\u8bbe\u5b9a\uff08persona\uff09\u548c\u6536\u76ca\u5c55\u793a\uff08payoff visibility\uff09\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Nash\u5747\u8861\u8fbe\u6210\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u89d2\u8272\u8eab\u4efd\u504f\u5411\u663e\u8457\u5e72\u6270\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u5b8c\u5168\u548c\u6536\u76ca\u6700\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e5f\u5982\u6b64\uff1b\u79fb\u9664persona\u5e76\u663e\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6536\u76ca\uff0cQwen\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u8fbe\u5230Nash\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u53cd\u4e4b\u5219\u504f\u5411\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u597d\u7ed3\u5c40\u3002Llama\u548cMistral\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u521a\u6027\u3002\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u6218\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u8005\u6216\u8eab\u4efd\u9a71\u52a8\u884c\u52a8\u8005\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6b64\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6709\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6218\u7565\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d7\u89d2\u8272\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u6536\u76ca\u4fe1\u606f\u5c55\u793a\u5f3a\u70c8\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5408\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1persona\u548c\u6536\u76ca\u5448\u73b0\u662f\u786e\u4fdd\u6a21\u578b\u6218\u7565\u5408\u7406\u6027\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u524d\u63d0\uff1b\u6cbb\u7406\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u89c6\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u73af\u8282\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u9700\u533a\u522b\u5bf9\u5f85\u3002"}}

Prior research documents negative attitudes toward AI users, but it remains unclear whether such disapproval translates into costly action. We address this question in a two-phase online experiment (N = 491 Phase II participants; Phase I provided targets) where participants could spend part of their own endowment to reduce the earnings of peers who had previously completed a real-effort task with or without LLM support. On average, participants destroyed 36% of the earnings of those who relied exclusively on the model, with punishment increasing monotonically with actual LLM use. Disclosure about LLM use created a credibility gap: self-reported null use was punished more harshly than actual null use, suggesting that declarations of \"no use\" are treated with suspicion. Conversely, at high levels of use, actual reliance on the model was punished more strongly than self-reported reliance.

Existing methods mainly rely on spatio-temporal interaction paradigms, where the sequential execution of multi-round dialogues incurs high latency and computation. Motivated by the recent insights that evaluation and debate mechanisms can improve problem-solving in multi-agent systems, we propose TopoDIM, a framework for one-shot Topology generation with Diverse Interaction Modes. Designed for decentralized execution to enhance adaptability and privacy, TopoDIM enables agents to autonomously construct heterogeneous communication without iterative coordination, achieving token efficiency and improved task performance. Experiments demonstrate that TopoDIM reduces total token consumption by 46.41% while improving average performance by 1.50% over state-of-the-art methods.

While interactive approaches introduce additional overhead, hybrid approaches depend on external components, which limit their scalability. A non-interactive, end-to-end framework enables reasoning to emerge within the model itself -- improving generalization while preserving analyzability without any external resources. In this work, we introduce a non-interactive, end-to-end framework for reasoning tasks. We show that introducing structural information into the few-shot prompt activates a subset of attention heads that patterns aligned with logical reasoning operators. Building on this insight, we propose Attention-Aware Intervention (AAI), an inference-time intervention method that reweights attention scores across selected heads identified by their logical patterns. AAI offers an efficient way to steer the model's reasoning toward leveraging prior knowledge through attention modulation. Extensive experiments show that AAI enhances logical reasoning performance across diverse benchmarks and model architectures, while incurring negligible additional computational overhead.

Inducing models to think for longer can increase their accuracy, but as the length of reasoning is further extended, it has also been shown to result in accuracy degradation and model instability. This work presents a novel sequential test-time scaling method, Min-Seek, which improves model accuracy significantly over a wide range of induced thoughts, stabilizing the accuracy of sequential scaling, and removing the need for reasoning length fine-tuning. Beyond improving model accuracy over a variety of reasoning tasks, our method is inherently efficient, as only the KV pairs of one additional induced thought are kept in the KV cache during reasoning. With a custom KV cache which stores keys without position embeddings, by dynamically encoding them contiguously before each new generated thought, our method can continue to reason well beyond a model's maximum context length, and under mild conditions has linear computational complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Min-Seek\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u5b58\u50a8\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u73b0\u6709\u5e8f\u8d2f\u63a8\u7406\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u89e3\u51b3\u968f\u7740\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u6570\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "Min-Seek\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2dKV\u7f13\u5b58\uff08\u4ec5\u591a\u4fdd\u5b58\u4e00\u4e2athought\u7684KV\u5bf9\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49KV\u7f13\u5b58\uff08\u53bb\u9664\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u957f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51faMin-Seek\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u514d\u53bb\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u5fae\u8c03\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "Min-Seek\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u5e8f\u8d2f\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u7528\u8f83\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8d85\u8d8a\u539f\u9650\u957f\uff0c\u4e14\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u3002"}}

Most existing approaches primarily optimize task performance and inference cost, and explicitly or implicitly assume sequential execution, making them less optimal for controlling latency under parallel execution. In this work, we investigate learning-based orchestration of multi-agent systems with explicit latency supervision under parallel execution. We propose Latency-Aware Multi-agent System (LAMaS), a latency-aware multi-agent orchestration framework that enables parallel execution and explicitly optimizes the critical execution path, allowing the controller to construct execution topology graphs with lower latency under parallel execution. Our experiments show that our approach reduces critical path length by 38-46% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline for multi-agent architecture search across multiple benchmarks, while maintaining or even improving task performance. These results highlight the importance of explicitly optimizing latency under parallel execution when designing efficient multi-agent systems.

Since its introduction in the human-AI interaction literature, it has gained traction by generalizing the reliance paradigm and by offering a more practical alternative to the contested construct of 'trust in AI.' Yet complementarity faces key theoretical challenges: it lacks precise theoretical anchoring, it is formalized just as a post hoc indicator of relative predictive accuracy, it remains silent about other desiderata of human-AI interactions and it abstracts away from the magnitude-cost profile of its performance gain. As a result, complementarity is difficult to obtain in empirical settings. In this work, we leverage epistemology to address these challenges by reframing complementarity within the discourse on justificatory AI. Drawing on computational reliabilism, we argue that historical instances of complementarity function as evidence that a given human-AI interaction is a reliable epistemic process for a given predictive task. Together with other reliability indicators assessing the alignment of the human-AI team with the epistemic standards and socio-technical practices, complementarity contributes to the degree of reliability of human-AI teams when generating predictions. This supports the practical reasoning of those affected by these outputs -- patients, managers, regulators, and others. In summary, our approach suggests that the role and value of complementarity lies not in providing a relative measure of predictive accuracy, but in helping calibrate decision-making to the reliability of AI-supported processes that increasingly shape everyday life.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6587\u53cd\u601d\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bba\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u89c6\u89d2\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u5176\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4ef7\u503c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e8e\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u9760\u51b3\u7b56\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u9886\u57df\u4e3b\u5f20'\u4e92\u8865\u6027'\uff0c\u5373\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a0AI\u7684\u56e2\u961f\u51b3\u7b56\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u4e3b\u4f53\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u4ec5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e8b\u540e\u6307\u6807\u3001\u5ffd\u89c6\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u672a\u8003\u8651\u2018\u6027\u80fd\u6536\u76ca\u7684\u6210\u672c\u2019\u7b49\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5e94\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bba\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7406\u8bba\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u6848\u4f8b\u4e3e\u8bc1\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u9610\u91ca\u8bba\u8bc1\u5176\u5bf9\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u91cd\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u4f5c\u8005\u4ee5\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bba\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u7eb3\u5165'\u8bc1\u6210\u6027AI'\u8ba8\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3b\u5f20\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u56e2\u961f\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5176\u4ed6\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6307\u6807\u6765\u5171\u540c\u6821\u51c6\u4eba\u673a\u56e2\u961f\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u610f\u4e49\u4e0d\u5728\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u4e8e\u5e2e\u52a9\u4eba\u4eec\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u7531AI\u652f\u6301\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u91c7\u7eb3\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Such workflow-driven designs are essentially rule-based decision trees, which suffer from two fundamental limitations: they require substantial manual effort to anticipate and encode possible task states, and they cannot exhaustively cover the state space of complex real-world tasks. To address these issues, we propose an Information-Flow-Orchestrated Multi-Agent Paradigm via Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication from CORAL, in which a dedicated information flow orchestrator continuously monitors task progress and dynamically coordinates other agents through the A2A toolkit using natural language, without relying on predefined workflows. We evaluate our approach on the general-purpose benchmark GAIA, using the representative workflow-based MAS OWL as the baseline while controlling for agent roles and underlying models. Under the pass@1 setting, our method achieves 63.64% accuracy, outperforming OWL's 55.15% by 8.49 percentage points with comparable token consumption. Further case-level analysis shows that our paradigm enables more flexible task monitoring and more robust handling of edge cases.

Although large language models (LLMs) are expressive, they struggle with precise multi-objective control and numeric reasoning without external structure and feedback. We introduce \\textbf{M olGen}, a fragment-level, retrieval-augmented, two-stage framework for molecule generation under multi-property constraints. Stage I : Prototype generation: a multi-agent reasoner performs retrieval-anchored, fragment-level edits to produce a candidate near the feasible region. Stage II : RL-based fine-grained optimization: a fragment-level optimizer trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) applies one- or multi-hop refinements to explicitly minimize the property errors toward our target while regulating edit complexity and deviation from the prototype. A large, automatically curated dataset with reasoning chains of fragment edits and measured property deltas underpins both stages, enabling deterministic, reproducible supervision and controllable multi-hop reasoning. Unlike prior work, our framework better reasons about molecules by leveraging fragments and supports controllable refinement toward numeric targets. Experiments on generation under two sets of property constraints (QED, LogP, Molecular Weight and HOMO, LUMO) show consistent gains in validity and precise satisfaction of multi-property targets, outperforming strong LLMs and graph-based algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 MolGen \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7247\u6bb5\u7ea7\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5177\u5907\u591a\u4e2a\u7406\u5316\u5c5e\u6027\u7cbe\u51c6\u6570\u503c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u662f\u5173\u952e\u4f46\u6781\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u4f20\u7edfLLM\u867d\u80fd\u63cf\u8ff0\u5206\u5b50\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u51c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u6570\u503c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 MolGen \u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7247\u6bb5\u7ea7\u68c0\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u63a5\u8fd1\u53ef\u884c\u57df\u7684\u5019\u9009\u5206\u5b50\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) \u7684\u7247\u6bb5\u7ea7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u7f16\u8f91\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0e\u539f\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u5b50\u5c5e\u6027\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u503c\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "MolGen \u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6307\u5b9a\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6bd4\u4e3b\u6d41 LLM \u548c\u56fe\u7b97\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u7cbe\u786e\u6ee1\u8db3\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "MolGen \u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u7247\u6bb5\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u6570\u503c\u578b\u5206\u5b50\u5c5e\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf LLM \u548c\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, real-world interactions are dynamic, where user interests continuously evolve, posing a challenge for models to adapt to preference drift without catastrophic forgetting. Standard continual learning approaches often struggle in this context, as they indiscriminately update on noisy interaction streams, failing to distinguish genuine preference shifts from transient contexts. To address this, we introduce SPRInG, a novel semi-parametric framework designed for effective continual personalization. During training, SPRInG employs drift-driven selective adaptation, which utilizes a likelihood-based scoring function to identify high-novelty interactions.

Moreover, these methods suffer from a stark accuracy-efficiency trade-off: high performance demands excessive computation, while fast variants compromise quality. We present Memo-SQL, a training-free framework that addresses these issues through two simple ideas: structured decomposition and experience-aware self-correction. Instead of leaving decomposition to chance, we apply three clear strategies, entity-wise, hierarchical, and atomic sequential, to encourage diverse reasoning. For correction, we build a dynamic memory of both successful queries and historical error-fix pairs, and use retrieval-augmented prompting to bring relevant examples into context at inference time, no fine-tuning or external APIs required.

Traditional numerical methods exhibit several inherent limitations, prompting Deep Learning (DL) as a promising alternative. The effectiveness of current DL techniques typically depends on the availability of high-quantity and high-accuracy datasets, which are yet difficult to obtain in large deformation problems. During the dataset construction process, a dilemma stands between data quantity and data accuracy, leading to suboptimal performance in the DL models. To address this challenge, we focus on a representative application of large deformations, the stretch bending problem, and propose FilDeep, a Fidelity-based Deep Learning framework for large Deformation of elastic-plastic solids. Our FilDeep aims to resolve the quantity-accuracy dilemma by simultaneously training with both low-fidelity and high-fidelity data, where the former provides greater quantity but lower accuracy, while the latter offers higher accuracy but in less quantity. In FilDeep, we provide meticulous designs for the practical large deformation problem. Particularly, we propose attention-enabled cross-fidelity modules to effectively capture long-range physical interactions across MF data. To the best of our knowledge, our FilDeep presents the first DL framework for large deformation problems using MF data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FilDeep consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance and can be efficiently deployed in manufacturing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\uff08MF\uff09\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u51b3\u5f39\u5851\u6027\u5927\u53d8\u5f62\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5FilDeep\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u517c\u987e\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f39\u5851\u6027\u5927\u53d8\u5f62\u5728\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u4e2d\u6781\u5176\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u7a81\u7834\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5927\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u517c\u987e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9a71\u52a8\u4e86FilDeep\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u63d0\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\uff0cFilDeep\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u636e\u6e90\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u8de8\u4fdd\u771f\u6a21\u5757\u6355\u6349\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u5927\u53d8\u5f62\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6FilDeep\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5f39\u5851\u6027\u56fa\u4f53\u5927\u53d8\u5f62\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\u3002FilDeep\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\uff08\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9ad8\u6570\u91cf\uff09\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\uff08\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4e\u6570\u91cf\uff09\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6765\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u6743\u8861\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u62c9\u4f38\u5f2f\u66f2\u8fd9\u4e00\u5178\u578b\u5236\u9020\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u878d\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8de8\u4fdd\u771f\u6a21\u5757\uff0cFilDeep\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u957f\u7a0b\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u53d8\u5f62\u6570\u503c\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "FilDeep\u5728\u6709\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u5236\u9020\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u62c9\u4f38\u5f2f\u66f2\uff09\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5927\u53d8\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u9886\u57df\u5185\u5e94\u7528\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

With the release of the first widely adopted reasoning model, o1, on December 5th, 2024, the field shifted from single-pass pattern generation to multi-step deliberation inference, accelerating deployment, experimentation, and new classes of applications. As this shift unfolded at a rapid pace, our empirical understanding of how these models have actually been used in practice has lagged behind. In this work, we leverage the OpenRouter platform, which is an AI inference provider across a wide variety of LLMs, to analyze over 100 trillion tokens of real-world LLM interactions across tasks, geographies, and time. In our empirical study, we observe substantial adoption of open-weight models, the outsized popularity of creative roleplay (beyond just the productivity tasks many assume dominate) and coding assistance categories, plus the rise of agentic inference.

Accepted at The Web Conference (WWW) 2026", "summary": "As knowledge and semantics on the web grow increasingly complex, enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) comprehension and reasoning capabilities has become particularly important. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, it still falls short on logical reasoning tasks that rely on symbolic expressions and strict deductive rules. Neuro-symbolic methods address this gap by enforcing formal correctness through external solvers. Yet these solvers are highly format-sensitive, and small instabilities in model outputs can lead to frequent processing failures. LLM-driven approaches avoid parsing brittleness, but they lack structured representations and process-level error-correction mechanisms. To further enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we propose MatrixCoT, a structured CoT framework with a matrix-based plan. Specifically, we normalize and type natural language expressions, attach explicit citation fields, and introduce a matrix-based planning method to preserve global relations among steps. The plan becomes a verifiable artifact, making execution more stable. For verification, we also add a feedback-driven replanning mechanism. Under semantic-equivalence constraints, it identifies omissions and defects, rewrites and compresses the dependency matrix, and produces a more trustworthy final answer. Experiments on five logical-reasoning benchmarks and five LLMs show that, without relying on external solvers, MatrixCoT enhances both robustness and interpretability when tackling complex symbolic reasoning tasks, while maintaining competitive performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "MatrixCoT\u5229\u7528\u77e9\u9635\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740Web\u4e0a\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5373\u4f7f\u91c7\u7528Chain-of-Thought\uff08CoT\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0e\u4e25\u683c\u6f14\u7ece\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4ecd\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u683c\u5f0f\u654f\u611f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0cLLM\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u5931\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u793a\u548c\u7ea0\u9519\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMatrixCoT\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e9\u9635\u7ed3\u6784\u7684CoT\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u4e3a\uff1a1\uff09\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u5316\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u3001\u9644\u5e26\u663e\u5f0f\u5f15\u7528\u5b57\u6bb5\uff0c2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u77e9\u9635\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u6b65\u9aa4\u95f4\u5168\u5c40\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8ba1\u5212\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff0c3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\u673a\u5236\u7ea6\u675f\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u7f3a\u6f0f/\u7f3a\u9677\u5e76\u91cd\u5199\u53ca\u538b\u7f29\u4f9d\u8d56\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u4e94\u6b3eLLM\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cMatrixCoT\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MatrixCoT\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e9\u9635\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u53cd\u9988\u4fee\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347LLM\u590d\u6742\u7b26\u53f7\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Using a simple but representative repurchase scenario, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs in zero-shot settings against both statistical and machine-learning models. Two key findings emerge. First, while LLMs surpass lightweight statistical baselines, they consistently underperform dedicated machine-learning models, showing their limited ability to capture quantitative temporal structure. Second, although moderate context can improve LLM accuracy, adding further user-level detail degrades performance.

Models trained on static historical data often overfit, resulting in poor generalization in dynamic markets. The mantra \"History Is Not Enough\" underscores the need for adaptive data generation that learns to evolve with the market rather than relying solely on past observations. We present a drift-aware dataflow system that integrates machine learning-based adaptive control into the data curation process. The system couples a parameterized data manipulation module comprising single-stock transformations, multi-stock mix-ups, and curation operations, with an adaptive planner-scheduler that employs gradient-based bi-level optimization to control the system.

The Decision Transformer (DT) introduced a powerful paradigm by framing RL as an autoregressive sequence modeling problem. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in complex reasoning and planning tasks. This inspires us whether LLMs, which share the same Transformer foundation, but operate at a much larger scale, can unlock new levels of performance in long-horizon sequential decision-making problem. This work investigates the application of LLMs to offline decision making tasks. A fundamental challenge in this domain is the LLMs' inherent inability to interpret continuous values, as they lack a native understanding of numerical magnitude and order when values are represented as text strings. To address this, we propose treating trajectories as a distinct modality. By learning to align trajectory data with natural language task descriptions, our model can autoregressively predict future decisions within a cohesive framework we term DecisionLLM. We establish a set of scaling laws governing this paradigm, demonstrating that performance hinges on three factors: model scale, data volume, and data quality. In offline experimental benchmarks and bidding scenarios, DecisionLLM achieves strong performance. Specifically, DecisionLLM-3B outperforms the traditional Decision Transformer (DT) by 69.4 on Maze2D umaze-v1 and by 0.085 on AuctionNet.

Current GNN-based PRL methods typically rely on single-perspective graph construction strategies, which capture partial properties of residue interactions, resulting in incomplete protein representations. To address this limitation, we propose MMPG, a framework that constructs protein graphs from multiple perspectives and adaptively fuses them via Mixture of Experts (MoE) for PRL. MMPG constructs graphs from physical, chemical, and geometric perspectives to characterize different properties of residue interactions. To capture both perspective-specific features and their synergies, we develop an MoE module, which dynamically routes perspectives to specialized experts, where experts learn intrinsic features and cross-perspective interactions. We quantitatively verify that MoE automatically specializes experts in modeling distinct levels of interaction from individual representations, to pairwise inter-perspective synergies, and ultimately to a global consensus across all perspectives. Through integrating this multi-level information, MMPG produces superior protein representations and achieves advanced performance on four different downstream protein tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5e76\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u6784\u5efa\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u56fe\uff0c\u6355\u83b7\u6b8b\u57fa\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7279\u6027\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8868\u793a\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u5931\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u878d\u5408\u591a\u89d2\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8868\u793a\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u7269\u7406\u3001\u5316\u5b66\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u4e09\u79cd\u89c6\u89d2\u6784\u5efa\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6b8b\u57fa\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u56fe\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff08MoE\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408\u5404\u89c6\u89d2\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e2a\u4f53\u89c6\u89d2\u8868\u793a\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u4e13\u5bb6\u5206\u5de5\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMMPG\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u7269\u7406\u3001\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u591a\u4e2a\u89d2\u5ea6\u6784\u5efa\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u56fe\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u878d\u5408\u591a\u5143\u56fe\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cMMPG\u5728\u56db\u9879\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u7684GNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u56fe\u878d\u5408\u3001\u4e13\u5bb6\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6d41\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u534f\u540c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Downsampling offers a potential solution, but its impact on diagnostic signal content and classification performance remains insufficiently understood. This study presents a workflow for systematically evaluating information loss caused by downsampling in high-frequency time series. The workflow combines shape-based distortion metrics with classification outcomes from available feature-based machine learning models and feature space analysis to quantify how different downsampling algorithms and factors affect both waveform integrity and predictive performance. We use a three-class NMD classification task to experimentally evaluate the workflow. We demonstrate how the workflow identifies downsampling configurations that preserve diagnostic information while substantially reducing computational load. Analysis of shape-based distortion metrics showed that shape-aware downsampling algorithms outperform standard decimation, as they better preserve peak structure and overall signal morphology. The results provide practical guidance for selecting downsampling configurations that enable near real-time nEMG analysis and highlight a generalisable workflow that can be used to balance data reduction with model performance in other high-frequency time-series applications as well.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6ce2\u5f62\u5931\u771f\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4f18\u9009\u5f62\u72b6\u611f\u77e5\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u53ef\u5728\u786e\u4fdd\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u9ad8\u9891\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u901a\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u9488\u7535\u808c\u56fe\uff08nEMG\uff09\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u795e\u7ecf\u808c\u8089\u75be\u75c5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u9ad8\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u3002\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u53ef\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u5bf9\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4ee5\u5f62\u72b6\u5931\u771f\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u5b9a\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u6ce2\u5f62\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u5206\u7c7b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ad8\u9891\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5f62\u72b6\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u6ce2\u5f62\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u62bd\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u591a\u7c7bNMD\u5206\u7c7b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u6d41\u7a0b\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u517c\u987e\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u8ff0\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9009\u53d6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8nEMG\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u9ad8\u9891\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Current LLM routing methods assign entire queries to one model, treating all reasoning steps as equal. We propose TRIM (Targeted routing in multi-step reasoning tasks), which routes only critical steps$\\unicode{x2013}$those likely to derail the solution$\\unicode{x2013}$to larger models while letting smaller models handle routine continuations. Our key insight is that targeted step-level interventions can fundamentally transform inference efficiency by confining expensive calls to precisely those steps where stronger models prevent cascading errors. TRIM operates at the step-level: it uses process reward models to identify erroneous steps and makes routing decisions based on step-level uncertainty and budget constraints. We develop several routing strategies within TRIM, ranging from a simple threshold-based policy to more expressive policies that reason about long-horizon accuracy-cost trade-offs and uncertainty in step-level correctness estimates.

Our benchmark comprises 2,500 trivial geometric problems spanning 25 categories, each carefully crafted to be solvable purely through native geometric understanding, assuming known object locations. We assess a range of state-of-the-art models on NoReGeo, including frontier models like GPT-4, observing that even the most advanced systems achieve an overall maximum of 65% accuracy in binary classification tasks. Further, our ablation experiments demonstrate that such geometric understanding does not emerge through fine-tuning alone, indicating that effective training for geometric comprehension requires a specialized approach from the outset.

This limitation fails to penalize ungrounded \"lucky guesses,\" leaving the critical process of needle-in-a-haystack evidence retrieval largely unsupervised. To address this, we propose EAPO (Evidence-Augmented Policy Optimization). We first establish the Evidence-Augmented Reasoning paradigm, validating via Tree-Structured Evidence Sampling that precise evidence extraction is the decisive bottleneck for long-context reasoning. Guided by this insight, EAPO introduces a specialized RL algorithm where a reward model computes a Group-Relative Evidence Reward, providing dense process supervision to explicitly improve evidence quality. To sustain accurate supervision throughout training, we further incorporate an Adaptive Reward-Policy Co-Evolution mechanism. This mechanism iteratively refines the reward model using outcome-consistent rollouts, sharpening its discriminative capability to ensure precise process guidance.

These include respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) contamination, short-data instability in nonlinear metrics, and the neglect of individualized baselines in favor of population norms. We propose C-GRASP (Clinically-Grounded Reasoning for Affective Signal Processing), a guardrailed RAG-enhanced pipeline that decomposes HRV interpretation into eight traceable reasoning steps. Central to C-GRASP is a Z-score Priority Hierarchy that enforces the weighting of individualized baseline shifts over normative statistics. The system effectively mitigates spectral hallucinations through automated RSA-aware guardrails, preventing contamination of frequency-domain indices. Evaluated on 414 trials from the DREAMER dataset, C-GRASP integrated with high-scale reasoning models (e.g., MedGemma3-thinking) achieved superior performance in 4-class emotion classification (37.3% accuracy) and a Clinical Reasoning Consistency (CRC) score of 69.6%. Ablation studies confirm that the individualized Delta Z-score module serves as the critical logical anchor, preventing the \"population bias\" common in native LLMs. Ultimately, C-GRASP transitions affective computing from black-box classification to transparent, evidence-based clinical decision support, paving the way for safer AI integration in biomedical engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86C-GRASP\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u516b\u6b65\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u53ca\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u6743\u91cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u5fc3\u7387\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u60c5\u7eea\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u751f\u7406\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728HRV\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u9762\u5e38\u53d7\u751f\u7406\u5b66\u5e7b\u89c9\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5305\u62ecRSA\u6c61\u67d3\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ca\u7fa4\u4f53\u57fa\u7ebf\u504f\u501a\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u589e\u5f3a\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528RAG\u589e\u5f3a\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5c06HRV\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u516b\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408Z\u5206\u6570\u4f18\u5148\u5c42\u7ea7\u548cRSA\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u800c\u975e\u7fa4\u4f53\u5747\u503c\u8fdb\u884c\u6743\u91cd\u8d4b\u503c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u5316RSA\u76d1\u6d4b\u51cf\u5c11\u9891\u57df\u6c61\u67d3\u3002\u7528DREAMER\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u5173\u952e\u6a21\u5757\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "C-GRASP\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728DREAMER\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u56db\u5206\u7c7b\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe37.3%\uff0c\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u4e3a69.6%\u3002\u5173\u952eDelta Z-score\u6a21\u5757\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4eba\u53e3\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u6574\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u9002\u5e94\u4e34\u5e8a\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "C-GRASP\u7cfb\u7edf\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86HRV\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u7684AI\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing refusal strategies for such queries either rely on output-level instruction following, which is brittle due to model hallucinations, or estimate output uncertainty, which adds complexity and overhead. To address this challenge, we formalize safe refusal in text-to-SQL systems as an answerability-gating problem and propose LatentRefusal, a latent-signal refusal mechanism that predicts query answerability from intermediate hidden activations of a large language model. We introduce the Tri-Residual Gated Encoder, a lightweight probing architecture, to suppress schema noise and amplify sparse, localized cues of question-schema mismatch that indicate unanswerability. Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse ambiguous and unanswerable settings, together with ablation studies and interpretability analyses, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and show that LatentRefusal provides an attachable and efficient safety layer for text-to-SQL systems.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated prowess in short-horizon reasoning, they are easily overwhelmed by execution details in the high-dimensional, delayed-feedback environments of real-world research, failing to consolidate sparse feedback into coherent long-term guidance. Here, we present ML-Master 2.0, an autonomous agent that masters ultra-long-horizon machine learning engineering (MLE) which is a representative microcosm of scientific discovery. By reframing context management as a process of cognitive accumulation, our approach introduces Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), a multi-tiered architecture inspired by computer systems that enables the structural differentiation of experience over time. By dynamically distilling transient execution traces into stable knowledge and cross-task wisdom, HCC allows agents to decouple immediate execution from long-term experimental strategy, effectively overcoming the scaling limits of static context windows. In evaluations on OpenAI's MLE-Bench under 24-hour budgets, ML-Master 2.0 achieves a state-of-the-art medal rate of 56.44%.

However, existing evaluation methods, including LLM-based evaluators, mainly adopt a black-box and holistic paradigm without explicit error modeling, leading to the neglect of such defects and overestimation of question quality. To address this issue, we propose ErrEval, a flexible and Error-aware Evaluation framework that enhances QG evaluation through explicit error diagnostics. Specifically, ErrEval reformulates evaluation as a two-stage process of error diagnosis followed by informed scoring. At the first stage, a lightweight plug-and-play Error Identifier detects and categorizes common errors across structural, linguistic, and content-related aspects.

Privacy policies are often difficult for people to fully comprehend due to the lengthy and complex legal language used and inconsistent practices across different sectors and organisations. To help conduct automated and large-scale analyses of privacy policies, many researchers have studied applications of machine learning and natural language processing techniques, including large language models (LLMs). While a limited number of prior studies utilised LLMs for extracting personal data flows from privacy policies, our approach builds on this line of work by combining LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a customised knowledge base derived from existing studies. This paper presents the development of LADFA, an end-to-end computational framework, which can process unstructured text in a given privacy policy, extract personal data flows and construct a personal data flow graph, and conduct analysis of the data flow graph to facilitate insight discovery. The framework consists of a pre-processor, an LLM-based processor, and a data flow post-processor. We demonstrated and validated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach by conducting a case study that involved examining ten selected privacy policies from the automotive industry. Moreover, it is worth noting that LADFA is designed to be flexible and customisable, making it suitable for a range of text-based analysis tasks beyond privacy policy analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LADFA\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u53d6\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u3002\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6c7d\u8f66\u884c\u4e1a\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u7531\u4e8e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u672f\u8bed\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u884c\u4e1a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u666e\u901a\u7528\u6237\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u7684\u5728\u4e8e\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e0e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u900f\u660e\u6027\u548c\u6d1e\u5bdf\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u5927\u73af\u8282\uff1a\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u6587\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u51c6\u5907\uff1bLLM\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u7ed3\u5408RAG\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u63d0\u53d6\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u6d41\uff1b\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u56fe\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5341\u4efd\u6c7d\u8f66\u884c\u4e1a\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u6848\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "LADFA\u5728\u5341\u4efd\u6c7d\u8f66\u884c\u4e1a\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8f83\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u56fe\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LADFA\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u4ece\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u56fe\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u5907\u7075\u6d3b\u5b9a\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u6587\u672c\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

While test-time alignment offers a promising alternative, existing approaches often rely on distorted trajectory-level signals or inefficient sampling, fundamentally capping performance and failing to preserve the generative diversity of the base model. This paper introduces LLMdoctor, a novel framework for efficient test-time alignment that operates via a patient-doctor paradigm. It integrates token-level reward acquisition with token-level flow-guided preference optimization (TFPO) to steer a large, frozen patient LLM with a smaller, specialized doctor model. Unlike conventional methods that rely on trajectory-level rewards, LLMdoctor first extracts fine-grained, token-level preference signals from the patient model's behavioral variations. These signals then guide the training of the doctor model via TFPO, which establishes flow consistency across all subtrajectories, enabling precise token-by-token alignment while inherently preserving generation diversity.

To address this problem, we present NSR-Boost, a neuro-symbolic residual boosting framework designed specifically for industrial scenarios. Its core advantage lies in being \"non-intrusive\". It treats the legacy model as a frozen model and performs targeted repairs on \"hard regions\" where predictions fail. The framework comprises three key stages: first, finding hard regions through residuals, then generating interpretable experts by generating symbolic code structures using Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning parameters using Bayesian optimization, and finally dynamically integrating experts with legacy model output through a lightweight aggregator. We report on the successful deployment of NSR-Boost within the core financial risk control system at Qfin Holdings. This framework not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines across six public datasets and one private dataset, more importantly, shows excellent performance gains on real-world online data. In conclusion, it effectively captures long-tail risks missed by traditional models and offers a safe, low-cost evolutionary paradigm for industry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf-\u7b26\u53f7\u6b8b\u5dee\u63d0\u5347\u6846\u67b6NSR-Boost\uff0c\u5bf9\u5df2\u6709GBDT\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8865\u507f\u5f3a\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6574\u4f53\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u9057\u6f0f\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "GBDT\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4e86\u5de5\u4e1a\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u5e76\u53d1\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5347\u7ea7\u8fed\u4ee3\u7531\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6f14\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b9a\u4f4d'\u56f0\u96be\u533a\u57df'\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u6574\u53c2\u6570\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u805a\u5408\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u96c6\u6210\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e0e\u65e7\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u96be\u70b9\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u98ce\u9669\u63a7\u5236\u573a\u666f\u771f\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7ebf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u516d\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u79c1\u6709\u96c6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cNSR-Boost\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5168\u9762\u4f18\u4e8eSOTA\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7ebf\u4e0a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4e5f\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u80fd\u8865\u8db3\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u9057\u6f0f\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "NSR-Boost\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u91d1\u878d\u98ce\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u548c\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5730\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u6f14\u8fdb\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce and apply a multi-layered diagnostic framework to a cross-architectural study. We fine-tune Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Mistral models on a high-stakes phishing detection task and use SHAP analysis and mechanistic interpretability to uncover the root causes of their generalization failures. Our investigation reveals three critical findings: (1) Generalization is driven by a powerful synergy between architecture and data diversity. The Gemma 2 9B model achieves state-of-the-art performance (>91\\% F1), but only when trained on a stylistically diverse ``generalist'' dataset. (2) Generalization is highly architecture-dependent.

However, whether these advances yield commensurate improvements in safety remains unclear, in part due to fragmented evaluation practices limited to single modalities or threat models. In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5. We evaluate each model across language, vision-language, and image generation settings using a unified protocol that integrates benchmark evaluation, adversarial evaluation, multilingual evaluation, and compliance evaluation. Aggregating our evaluations into safety leaderboards and model safety profiles across multiple evaluation modes reveals a sharply heterogeneous safety landscape. While GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced safety performance across evaluations, other models exhibit pronounced trade-offs among benchmark safety, adversarial alignment, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Both language and vision-language modalities show significant vulnerability under adversarial evaluation, with all models degrading substantially despite strong results on standard benchmarks. Text-to-image models achieve relatively stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain brittle under adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these results show that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation scheme, underscoring the need for standardized safety evaluations to accurately assess real-world risk and guide responsible model development and deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u672a\u5fc5\u5e26\u6765\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u6807\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4ee5\u53cd\u6620\u5b9e\u9645\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u548cMLLM\u5728\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8fdb\u5c55\u5c1a\u672a\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u8bc4\u6d4b\u624b\u6bb5\u788e\u7247\u5316\u4e14\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\u6216\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u8584\u5f31\u73af\u8282\u3002", "method": "\u5bf97\u4e2a\u6700\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\uff08GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, Seedream 4.5\uff09\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u79cd\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u534f\u8bae\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "GPT-5.2\u5728\u5404\u9879\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5747\u8861\uff1b\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u3001\u8de8\u8bed\u79cd\u6cdb\u5316\u53ca\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u6743\u8861\u3002\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0b\u5747\u663e\u8457\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76d1\u7ba1\u8981\u6c42\u4e0b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u98ce\u9669\u7c7b\u522b\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u7cca\u63d0\u793a\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u662f\u591a\u7ef4\u4e14\u590d\u6742\u7684\uff0c\u53d7\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u624b\u6bb5\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u5f00\u53d1\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, recent studies show that such alignment is often shallow and remains vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms, including decoding-based constraints and post-hoc content detectors, struggle against sophisticated jailbreaks, often intervening robust detection or excessively degrading model utility. In this work, we examine the decoding process of LLMs and make a key observation: even when successfully jailbroken, models internally exhibit latent safety-related signals during generation. However, these signals are overridden by the model's drive for fluent continuation, preventing timely self-correction or refusal. Building on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective approach that explicitly surfaces and leverages these latent safety signals for early detection of unsafe content during decoding. Experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances safety, while maintaining low over-refusal rates on benign inputs and preserving response quality. Our results suggest that activating intrinsic safety-awareness during decoding offers a promising and complementary direction for defending against jailbreak attacks.

A Mechanistic Analysis of Hierarchical Reasoning Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Hierarchical reasoning model (HRM) achieves extraordinary performance on various reasoning tasks, significantly outperforming large language model-based reasoners. To understand the strengths and potential failure modes of HRM, we conduct a mechanistic study on its reasoning patterns and find three surprising facts: (a) Failure of extremely simple puzzles, e.g., HRM can fail on a puzzle with only one unknown cell. We attribute this failure to the violation of the fixed point property, a fundamental assumption of HRM. (b) \"Grokking\" dynamics in reasoning steps, i.e., the answer is not improved uniformly, but instead there is a critical reasoning step that suddenly makes the answer correct; (c) Existence of multiple fixed points. HRM \"guesses\" the first fixed point, which could be incorrect, and gets trapped there for a while or forever. All facts imply that HRM appears to be \"guessing\" instead of \"reasoning\". Leveraging this \"guessing\" picture, we propose three strategies to scale HRM's guesses: data augmentation (scaling the quality of guesses), input perturbation (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging inference randomness), and model bootstrapping (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging training randomness). On the practical side, by combining all methods, we develop Augmented HRM, boosting accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme from 54.5% to 96.9%.

The approach causes fragmentation in information graphs in document structures, over-retrieval, and duplication of content alongside insufficient query context, including 2nd and 3rd order facets. In this paper, a structure-informed and diversity-constrained context bubble construction framework is proposed that assembles coherent, citable bundles of spans under a strict token budget. The method preserves and exploits inherent document structure by organising multi-granular spans (e.g., sections and rows) and using task-conditioned structural priors to guide retrieval. Starting from high-relevance anchor spans, a context bubble is constructed through constrained selection that balances query relevance, marginal coverage, and redundancy penalties. It will explicitly constrain diversity and budget, producing compact and informative context sets, unlike top-k retrieval. Moreover, a full retrieval is emitted that traces the scoring and selection choices of the records, thus providing auditability and deterministic tuning. Experiments on enterprise documents demonstrate the efficiency of context bubble as it significantly reduces redundant context, is better able to cover secondary facets and has a better answer quality and citation faithfulness within a limited context window. Ablation studies demonstrate that both structural priors as well as diversity constraint selection are necessary; removing either component results in a decline in coverage and an increase in redundant or incomplete context.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u529e\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edftop-k\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u3001\u66f4\u597d\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u9636\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u554f\u7b54\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65f6\u5e38\u9762\u4e34\u4fe1\u606f\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u5197\u4f59\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6587\u6863\u76842\u9636\u30013\u9636\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u3002\u672c\u6587\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u5316\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684Context Bubble\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u76f8\u5173\u951a\u5b9a\u6bb5\u843d\uff0c\u5728\u9650\u5b9atoken\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u7ae0\u8282\u3001\u884c\uff09\u7ec4\u5408\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u8fb9\u9645\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u53ef\u5f15\u7528\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5305\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u5168\u68c0\u7d22\u56de\u6eaf\u673a\u5236\u4f7f\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3001\u53ef\u8c03\u4f18\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u6587\u6863\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f83\u4f20\u7edftop-k\u68c0\u7d22\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u8986\u76d6\u4e8c\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5f15\u7528\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7f3a\u4e00\u4e0d\u53ef\uff0c\u79fb\u9664\u4efb\u4f55\u4e00\u9879\u90fd\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u8986\u76d6\u6027\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u5197\u4f59\u6216\u9057\u6f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684Context Bubble\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728token\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7ec4\u5efa\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5168\u9762\u4e14\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edftop-k\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Thirty-six student participants from Architectural Engineering and other disciplines completed a two-phase architectural design task, first independently and then with external tools (GenAI-assisted condition and control condition using an online repository of existing architectural projects). Design outcomes were evaluated by expert raters, while self-efficacy and cognitive load were self-reported after each phase. Difference-in-differences analyses revealed no overall performance advantage of GenAI across participants; however, subgroup analyses showed that GenAI significantly improved design performance for novice designers. In contrast, general creative self-efficacy declined for students using GenAI. Cognitive load did not differ significantly between conditions, though prompt usage patterns showed that iterative idea generation and visual feedback prompts were linked to greater reductions in cognitive load. These findings suggest that GenAI effectiveness depends on users' prior expertise and interaction strategies through prompting.", "AI": {"tldr": "GenAI\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u65b0\u624b\u5efa\u7b51\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u521b\u9020\u6027\u81ea\u6211\u6548\u80fd\u611f\uff0c\u5bf9\u6574\u4f53\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u65e0\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\u5f71\u54cd\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08GenAI\uff09\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u6982\u5ff5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8868\u73b0\u3001\u521b\u9020\u6027\u81ea\u6211\u6548\u80fd\u611f\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u96c636\u540d\u5efa\u7b51\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u4e13\u4e1a\u5b66\u751f\uff0c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u72ec\u7acb\u5b8c\u6210\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u8f85\u52a9\uff08GenAI\u6216\u5efa\u7b51\u9879\u76ee\u8d44\u6599\u5e93\uff09\uff0c\u7531\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u81ea\u6211\u62a5\u544a\u6548\u80fd\u611f\u53ca\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5dee\u5f02\u4e2d\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5206\u6790\u7ec4\u95f4\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u6574\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0cGenAI\u672a\u63d0\u5347\u6240\u6709\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u65b0\u624b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u4f7f\u7528GenAI\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u521b\u9020\u6027\u81ea\u6211\u6548\u80fd\u611f\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u5728\u5404\u6761\u4ef6\u95f4\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u63d0\u793a\u8fed\u4ee3\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u3002", "conclusion": "GenAI\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u4e13\u4e1a\u6c34\u5e73\u53ca\u5176\u63d0\u793a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u65b0\u624b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u5173\u6ce8\u81ea\u6211\u6548\u80fd\u611f\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5408\u9002\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u3002"}}
